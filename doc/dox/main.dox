\mainpage ROCS - Toolkit for Robots Comprehending Space

ROCS is a multi-language software toolkit containing algorithms providing
mobile robots with the ability to perceive and understand large-scale
real-world environments. ROCS contains implementations of algorithms for
mobile robot localization, extraction of semantic information about
environment from robotic sensors, place categorization etc.

More information about the usage, structure as well as the algorithms
implemented in ROCS can be found below.
