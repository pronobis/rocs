# This module allows using data from a VPC sequence.
# http://categorizingplaces.com/dataset.html
#
# VPC sequences are identified with url to: VPC/<home>
# Sequence data is then read from <path>/label.txt
#
# Since VPC does not provides data about the room, its impossible to know
# if the same room is visting twice or are diferent instances of a given category.
# For that reason functions as NumberOfEdges and NumberOfRooms are disabled.
